### C++ Udemy Course

So as I'm learning about C++ classes and objects, I've run into operator overloading.  The concept is somewhat easy enough to grasp, but the implementation gets a little muddy.  While I'm a section-and-a-half away from completing my Straighterline C++ course, I'd really like to take a few days and lock in the knowledge by supplementing with a Udemy course as well as going through my saved C++ tabs.

Here's the link to the Udemy course I've chosen to learn C++...

### Let's dive deeper into the why, for a minute

I could easily be pushing myself forward in UI engineering, focusing strictly on the frontend and doing cool things like animations, transitions, and what not, but I think I'm really lacking the true building blocks to software engineering.  Also, and maybe I mentioned this before, but I've received zero callbacks for the applications I've submitted.  I know there are many other things I could focus on, like beautifying my GitHub (which I am slowly doing), dialing in my LinkedIn, contributing to open source, etc etc etc., and I will do these things in due time, but I'm trying to get a real solid grasp on the wonder that is Computer Science.

### There are other areas of my life I'd like to dial in, as well

Diet and exercise.  Diet and EXERCISE.  DIET AND EXERCISE!!!!

Need I say more?

### Learning C++ through Straighterline

I am on section 7 now, the introduction to objects.  The rest of the course up to this point has been pretty good, though I've had to supplement here and there.  I did find one bug the I reported through feedback and they assured me that they were correct, even though I tested it.

While my primary focus was on modern web development with full-stack JavaScript, I am really enjoying C++ and would like to make a few applications using a cross-platform GUI app using wxWidgets or QT 6 or whatever else I land on.

### Why am I learning through Straighterline?

Well, I've been studying web development and building projects for a few years now.  I do have prior project experience, such as learning HTML and CSS in the late 90's, then building a game with the Corona SDK and Lua around 2008-9.  I've also studied C and C++ here and there over the years (C through Udemy and C++ through WiBit).

It wasn't until 2019 until I took it serious enough to pursue a career in development / engineering.  At that time, just as now, there is so much information available about learning web development that I kind of experienced analysis paralysis.  So I went back to Udemy, bought and completed some courses, and have been building projects since.

Fast forward to today, I have a pretty good grasp on full-stack web development, particularly with the MERN stack, but I haven't been successful in landing employment.  I was recently served some videos on YouTube about WGU and how to fast-track a degree in CompSci, and I bit, thinking that if I took a few months to a year, I could increase the likelihood of getting a call-back from a potential employer.

And here I am today, taking CS101 through Straighterline, whouch should transfer over to WGU along with some other core classes.

More to come!
